**Me:**
It is a long journey. I think, the best way how to describe it is by the image.

**Mikhail Larkin:**
The code is in alfa version, but is not shity code, it is a pretty clear.

## Final Review (10. 05. 2022)
This project was about a small website with options line registrations, login and CRUD posts.
First, I've created a database and backend. I used MySQL and Laravel 9.
After that, I started working with VueJS and Bootstrap and created a frontend.

One of my biggest problem was time management and understanding the Vue language.
The language is still new for me, and it was challenging in the beginning.

Now I finally have some fundamental skills with using Vue and Laravel together.
Also, I hope, I am now more able to work with time management and prioritising the tasks.

###### Troubleshooting
* type: npm run serve but nothing is on screen?
* type: npm run hot 
  * if it shows an error like "Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use ::1:8080"
  * type: killall node
* and again: npm run hot
